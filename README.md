# Points to cover
1. Please fix all the things from #1-9 (search for #1, #2 so on)

2. Let's try to work with real server.

- I've added quick solution for the server - https://github.com/typicode/json-server

- Please do `npm i`. You can start the app with the command `npm run start-mocks-app`

- Here you can find some rest calls - `src\app\app.component.ts`

- Let's do CRUD operations through the server calls (through effects)

# Second review
- I've added new points from #10 - #24, please take a look
- On my side app is workable with `npm run start-mocks-app`
